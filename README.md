How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Test your code often with real scenarios, review it carefully, and use trusted security practices like input validation and encryption to guard against vulnerabilities.

How do I approach designing software?

Start by planning out what the software needs to do, sketch how everything fits together, and build it step-by-step, keeping it organized and flexible for future changes.
